# Advising Dashboard

## Overview
This is a **Streamlit-based Advising Dashboard** for Phoenix University that helps academic advisors track student progress and course eligibility across multiple majors (PBHL, SPTH-New, SPTH-Old).

**Purpose**: Enable advisors to:
- View student course completion and registration status
- Check course eligibility based on prerequisites and standing
- Manage advising sessions and recommendations per major
- Sync data with Google Drive for backup and collaboration

**Current State**: ✅ Fully functional and ready to use
- Python 3.11 environment configured
- All dependencies installed
- Streamlit running on port 5000
- Deployment configured for production

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-24: Performance Optimizations & Bug Fixes
- ✅ **Drive Performance**: Implemented service caching and file download caching to eliminate redundant API calls
- ✅ **Autoload Fixed**: Files now automatically load from Drive when available for each major
- ✅ **SSL Retry Logic**: Added 3-attempt retry with 2-second delays for intermittent SSL errors during uploads
- ✅ **Secrets Safety**: Fixed crashes when Drive isn't configured - app now gracefully handles missing secrets
- ✅ **Local-First Sessions**: Advising sessions save instantly to local cache, then sync to Drive in background

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Streamlit (Python web framework for data apps)
- **Data**: Pandas, openpyxl for Excel file handling
- **Cloud Integration**: Google Drive API (optional)
- **Deployment**: Replit autoscale deployment

```

### Key Features
1. **Multi-Major Support**: Track data separately for PBHL, SPTH-New, SPTH-Old
2. **Course Eligibility**: Automatic checking based on prerequisites, corequisites, concurrent requirements, and student standing
3. **Google Drive Sync**: Optional cloud backup with versioning
4. **Student Views**: 
   - Eligibility view (which courses students can take)
   - Full student view (complete progress tracking)
5. **Advising Sessions**: Track advisor recommendations and notes per student

## Configuration

### Streamlit Configuration
Location: `.streamlit/config.toml`
- Server bound to `0.0.0.0:5000` (required for Replit)
- CORS and XSRF protection disabled for iframe compatibility
- Headless mode enabled

### Google Drive Integration (Optional)
The app can sync with Google Drive for data backup and collaboration. To enable:

1. **Create Google Cloud Project** with Drive API enabled
2. **Generate OAuth credentials** (client_id, client_secret)
3. **Get refresh token** using `get_refresh_token.py`
4. **Add to Replit Secrets** (use the Secrets tab 🔒 in Replit sidebar):
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` = your-client-id
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` = your-client-secret
   - `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` = your-refresh-token
   - `GOOGLE_FOLDER_ID` = your-drive-folder-id

**Important**: The app works perfectly without Google Drive - you can upload files directly through the sidebar.

## How to Use

### Running Locally
The app starts automatically via the Streamlit workflow. Access it through the web preview.

### Uploading Data
1. **Select a major** from the dropdown (PBHL, SPTH-New, SPTH-Old)
2. **Upload files** via the sidebar:
   - Courses Table: `{MAJOR}_courses_table.xlsx`
   - Progress Report: `{MAJOR}_progress_report.xlsx` (can have Required + Intensive sheets)
   - Advising Selections: Optional CSV/XLSX with advisor recommendations

### Data Format Requirements
**Courses Table** should include columns:
- Course Code
- Offered (Yes/No)
- Prerequisite
- Concurrent
- Corequisite

**Progress Report** should include:
- ID, NAME
- Course code columns (values: 'c' = completed, 'nc' = not completed, blank = registered)
- # of Credits Completed
- # Registered
- # Remaining
- Total Credits

---

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for full list:
- streamlit
- pandas
- openpyxl (Excel support)
- pillow (image handling)
- google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-api-python-client (Drive integration)

---

## Deployment
Configured for **autoscale deployment** - the app scales automatically based on traffic.

To publish:
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Your app will be available at a public URL
3. Configure secrets in the deployment settings if using Google Drive

---

## Security Notes
- ✅ Secrets stored in Replit Secrets (not in code)
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured to exclude sensitive files
- ✅ Google credentials never exposed in logs or UI
- ⚠️ **Never share API credentials in chat or commit them to git**

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- Check that all Python packages are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify workflow is running in the Replit sidebar

### Google Drive not working
- App still works without Drive - you can upload files locally
- If you want Drive sync, check that all 4 secrets are configured correctly
- Run `get_refresh_token.py` to regenerate refresh token if expired

### Data not loading
- Ensure Excel files match the expected format and column names
- Check for file upload errors in the sidebar messages
- Verify the major-specific filenames (e.g., `PBHL_courses_table.xlsx`)
